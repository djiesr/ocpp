![OCPP](https://github.com/home-assistant/brands/raw/master/custom_integrations/ocpp/icon.png)

This is a temporary version awaiting the necessary fixes from United Chargers for the compatibility of the Grizzl-E Smart charger with the OCPP standards used in the original version created by lbbrhzn.

From [lbbrhzn/ocpp](https://github.com/lbbrhzn/ocpp), patched for **Grizzl-E Smart** charger.

Tested with the firmware: **GWM-07.013-03_GCW-10.18-05.7**

- No special instruction

Tested with the firmware: **GWM-07.020-03_GCW-10.18-05.7**

- **Before install the integration**, copy de "ocpp" folder of this [OPCC package](https://github.com/mobilityhouse/ocpp) in your "HA Config"/deps/lib/python3.11/site-packages/
- Than, you will modify BootNotification.json in folder "HA Config"/deps/lib/python3.11/site-packages/ocpp/v16/schemas/ at line 12 replace "maxLength": 20 by "maxLength": 30
- After you can do the instalation the integration.
- When you will add the intÃ©gration, check the box of "ignore the validation of the OCPP scheme" like:

(In french sorry)
- And, finish the instalation.

**OR**
  
You can do thew solution of **08jmm3**<br>
As a proof of concept I modified the firmware (version GWM-07.020-03) and shortened the reported chargePointModel to be within the proper character limit. Upon flashing the modified firmware it appears to be happy.<br>
Flash using: esptool.py --chip esp32 --baud 921600 write_flash 0x10000 GWM-07.020-03-mod.bin<br>
Note that this is for a Grizzl-E Smart Connect (v2) and the charger must be power cycled after flashing the update. Use at your own risk. I've also included the unmodified firmware in case you need to revert to the original.<br>
